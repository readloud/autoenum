| MITRE CVE - https://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2008-1693] The CairoFont::create function in CairoFontEngine.cc in Poppler, possibly before 0.8.0, as used in Xpdf, Evince, ePDFview, KWord, and other applications, does not properly handle embedded fonts in PDF files, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted font object, related to dereferencing a function pointer associated with the type of this font object.
| [CVE-2007-5665] STEngine.exe 3.5.0.20 in Novell ZENworks Endpoint Security Management (ESM) 3.5, and other ESM versions before 3.5.0.82, dynamically creates scripts in a world-writable directory when generating diagnostic reports, which allows local users to gain privileges, as demonstrated by creating a cmd.exe binary in the diagnostic report directory.
| [CVE-2013-0781] Use-after-free vulnerability in the nsPrintEngine::CommonPrint function in Mozilla Firefox before 19.0, Thunderbird before 17.0.3, and SeaMonkey before 2.16 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.
| [CVE-2012-0439] An ActiveX control in gwcls1.dll in the client in Novell GroupWise 8.0 before 8.0.3 HP2 and 2012 before SP1 HP1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) a pointer argument to the SetEngine method or (2) an XPItem pointer argument to an unspecified method.
| [CVE-2011-2148] Admin/frmSite.aspx in the SmarterTools SmarterStats 6.0 web server allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via vectors involving a leading and trailing & (ampersand) character, and (1) an STTTState cookie, (2) the ctl00%24MPH%24txtAdminNewPassword_SettingText parameter, (3) the ctl00%24MPH%24txtSmarterLogDirectory parameter, (4) the ctl00%24MPH%24ucSiteSeoSearchEngineSettings%24chklistEngines_SettingCheckBox%2414 parameter, (5) the ctl00%24MPH%24ucSiteSeoSettings%24txtSeoMaxKeywords_SettingText parameter, or (6) the ctl00_MPH_grdLogLocations_HiddenLSR parameter, related to an "OS command injection" issue.
